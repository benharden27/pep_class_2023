<p>Your final group activity is to present your research findings in a poster presentation. This will involve creating publication-ready figures, composing minimal text under headings, and designing a poster to combine all this information.</p>
<p>We will present these posters to each other and the wider PEP community on Thurs July 13 from 9a-10a.</p>
