<p>Now that we’ve reviewed our understanding of what a traditional hypothesis is and how we can apply that to oceanography, we need to apply that understanding to our research project.</p>
<div id="exercise" class="section level2">
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>Your job as a team is to create a list of possible hypotheses about your topic in the region of interest.</p>
<p>You should remember that a good hypothesis is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on background understanding (i.e. not just a guess)</li>
<li>Specific enough (i.e. not too broad as to be unhelpful)</li>
<li>Actually testable (i.e. something you have the data to test)</li>
</ul>
<p>You should do the following as a team:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Create a list of at least three possible hypotheses that you think you could test using your data</p></li>
<li><p>For each write down a list of possible factors that might limit your ability to test this hypothesis with your data. Note how important each might be and what possible mitigation you might apply.</p></li>
<li><p>For each sketch a figure that you might produce that could confirm or refute your data - what would the data look like if your hypothesis was confirmed?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have these, you should show them to me and we can discuss them and share feedback.</p>
<p>After sign-off from me you should then each individually:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Pick one hypothesis to test (can be the same as another group member)</p></li>
<li><p>Use ggplot to generate a figure (possibly similar to the one you proposed above) that could confirm or refute the hypothesis</p></li>
<li><p>Create a document that contains the hypothesis, the figure, a description of what the figure shows, and how it either confirms or refutes your hypothesis.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You can submit this individual work to the assignment below.</p>
