<p>Now that we’ve thought a little about effective teams and collaborators, we are going to draft a teamwork agreement for your class projects. This will be a document that will outline how your team will function and should cover the basics of your anticipated roles, communication strategy, and decision-making systems.</p>
<p>How this looks is up to your team. You should draft a document and submit it to the assignment below. Once you’ve done that I will review it and get back to you with any questions I have. Once you’ve answered these questions clearly then we will sign the document as our initial agreement for how the team will operate.</p>
<p>We will review this mid-class to edit and recommit to the terms you have defined as we get to know each other better and the team irons out some of it’s operations.</p>
