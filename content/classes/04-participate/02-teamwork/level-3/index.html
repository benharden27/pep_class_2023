<p>If you’ve chosen to complete this level, you should do so in the final week of class. By this time you will have developed a teamwork contract, reviewed it, attended the WHOI Ethic seminar and seem how your class project team has functioned in reality.</p>
<p>In this level we are going to reflect on our in-class collaboration and make some plans for future teamwork in science.</p>
<div id="teamwork-reflection" class="section level2">
<h2>Teamwork reflection</h2>
<p>Start by using the team contract that you developed as a starting point to analyze how you team functioned. You should write a single page reflection that seeks to answer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>In general, what did your team do well and what could have been improved?</li>
<li>What contribution did you make and did it feel equitable?</li>
<li>Which particular parts of the contract were useful as a tool to ensure that teamwork progressed as you might hope?</li>
<li>Which parts were too general/vague to be helpful and how would you change some of them to be more useful?</li>
</ul>
<p>You should submit this to the assignment below. Once I’ve had a chance to review it, we can chat about the process.</p>
</div>
<div id="ten-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Ten Questions</h2>
<p>Finally, as a tool for you to use going forward, I’d like you to compose ten questions that you would like to ask yourself the next time you start working as part of a team.</p>
<p>Think about questions that will help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand what you can (and want) to bring to the team</li>
<li>Examine what you might expect form others</li>
<li>Craft a open, supportive environment</li>
<li>Generally set both you and the wider team up for success</li>
</ul>
<p>Submit these questions on the same document as above and we can chat about them.
and start thinking about craft ten questions that you would</p>
