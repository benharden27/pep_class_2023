<p>We crowd sourced a good amount of this level content as a class including setting up some basic criteria for the creation of a successful team.</p>
<p>What came to the surface through this exercise is that a team is successful if they can work together effectively to reach a common goal. This goal is typically not achievable by any one individual alone.</p>
<p>Some features of successful teams that we discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Strong communication strategies including clear expectations, etiquette, and ability to resolve conflicts constructively</p></li>
<li><p>Distinct roles such that everyone knows what part they play and can take ownership and have buy-in.</p></li>
<li><p>Equitable division of labor: Fair is not always equal, but everyone should feel they are contributing what they can and taking an equitable burden.</p></li>
<li><p>A clear plan. Knowing your goal is one this, but success in reaching it usually requires a clear plan and a system to both enact the plan and make decisions should the plan not work as effectively as they had hoped.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically in the science world, we call this teamwork collaboration. We will learn something of the ethics of collaboration at the WHOI Ethics Seminar on June 23, but here are a couple of other reflections on effective collaboration:</p>
