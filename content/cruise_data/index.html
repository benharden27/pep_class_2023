<p>Our research projects will be centered on the data we collected during our 4 day cruise on the <em>SSV Corwith Cramer</em>. We sailed out of Woods Hole, along Vineyard Sounds and out onto the inner New England Continental Shelf before looping back through Buzzards Bay and Nantucket Sound.During the cruise we undertook four sampling stations to collect data from CTD, niskin bottles, and neuston net.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Below are links to the data collected during the cruise. You should create a new project in RStudio, download the data and copy it across into your new project folder. Each file is a csv file which should be well-formatted and easy to read into R using <code>read_csv(&lt;filename&gt;)</code>/.</p>
<p>For each data stream, I’ve included the relevant metadata for you to determine what the column names mean.</p>
</div>
<div id="stations" class="section level2">
<h2>Stations</h2>
<p>First off is the simple station location data.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="data/C308C_summary_datasheet.csv">Station location data</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This includes the following columns</p>
<ul>
<li>station: station number</li>
<li>deployment: code for what kind of station it was (B - bottle data from niskins, NT - neuston tow, SD - Secchi Disc)</li>
<li>date: date of deployment</li>
<li>time_in: time that the gear was deployed in local time</li>
<li>time_out: time the deployment ended (usually only recorded for neuston tows)</li>
<li>zd: Zone descriptions - how many hours behind UTC (Greenwich time)</li>
<li>dttm: Date and time of station in universal format</li>
<li>lon: Longitude (in deg E)</li>
<li>lat: Latitude (in deg N)</li>
<li>temp: Surface temperature at station (degC)</li>
<li>sal: Surface salinity at station</li>
<li>fluor: Surface fluoresense at station (V)</li>
<li>station_distance: If out time was recorded, this is the distance the ship moved during the deployment. Useful for net tow calculations</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="flowthrough" class="section level2">
<h2>Flowthrough</h2>
<p>The flowthrough data is continuous surface data recorded whenever the ship is in transit along the cruise track. This includes our location but also surface salinity, temperature, and fluorescence (chl-a).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="data/C308C_elg.csv">Flowthrough Data</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The columns are:</p>
<ul>
<li>dttm: Date and time</li>
<li>lon: Longitude (decimal degrees east of 0)</li>
<li>lat: Latitude (decimal degrees north of 0)</li>
<li>temp: Surface temperature (°C)</li>
<li>sal: Surface salinity (PSU)</li>
<li>fluor: Surface fluorescence (Volts - a measure of chlorophyll-a concentration)</li>
<li>cdom: Color Dissolved Organic Matter (Volts - measure of ocean pigment)</li>
<li>xmiss: Transmissivity (V - a measure of oceans opacity)</li>
<li>wind_sp: Wind speed in m/s</li>
<li>wind_dir: Wind direction in degrees from North</li>
<li>heading: Ships heading in (°T)</li>
<li>pitch: Ship’s pitch (forward and back motion)</li>
<li>roll: Ship’ roll (side to side motion)</li>
<li>filename: Original filename from which data was processed</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="ctd" class="section level2">
<h2>CTD</h2>
<p>When we stopped on station, we lowered the CTD carousel to the sea floor. While this was happening, the CTD was recording continuous measurements of temperature, salinity, pressure, light availability and fluorescence.</p>
<p>One note on this data is that the CTD file for the 001 station got corrupted on transfer and we haven’t been able to process it.</p>
<p>I have included the data in a couple of formats. One data file contains all the available CTD casts in one csv. But I have also broken each cast out into their own file. I would recommend using these individual files when taking your first steps into R data vis although you may find the combined data easiest to use when approaching slightly less basic plotting</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="data/C308C-002_ctd.csv">CTD data Station 2</a></li>
<li><a href="data/C308C-003_ctd.csv">CTD data Station 3</a></li>
<li><a href="data/C308C-004_ctd.csv">CTD data Station 4</a></li>
<li><a href="data/C308C-006_ctd.csv">CTD data Station 6</a></li>
<li><a href="data/C308C_ctd.csv">CTD data All</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The columns are</p>
<ul>
<li>cruise: cruise ID</li>
<li>station: Station number for the cruise</li>
<li>lon: longitude</li>
<li>lat: latitude</li>
<li>dttm: Date and time</li>
<li>dep: Depth of measurement (m)</li>
<li>fluor: Fluorescence (V - measure of chl-a concentration)</li>
<li>oxygen2: Oxygen concentration</li>
<li>par: Photosynthetically Available Radiation (microEinsteins - measure of light availability)</li>
<li>pres: Pressure at depth of measurement (dbar)</li>
<li>sal: Salinity (PSU)</li>
<li>sigtheta: Potential Density (kg/m3)</li>
<li>temp: Temperature (°C)</li>
<li>theta: Potential Temperature (°C)</li>
<li>file: Original filename of data</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="bottles" class="section level2">
<h2>Bottles</h2>
<p>As we lower the CTD we also lower the 12 niskin bottles of the carousel. We shut these at difference depths and then drew that water off when it gets back to the surface. We then analyzed that water for chl-a, nitrates, and pH.</p>
<p>As with the CTD data I’ve broken each cast out into it’s own file (see above), but I’ve also included a combined data file which you might find it easier to use for more advance R plotting.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="data/C308C-002_bottle.csv">Bottle Station 2</a></li>
<li><a href="data/C308C-003_bottle.csv">Bottle Station 3</a></li>
<li><a href="data/C308C-004_bottle.csv">Bottle Station 4</a></li>
<li><a href="data/C308C-006_bottle.csv">Bottle Station 6</a></li>
<li><a href="data/C308C_bottle_datasheet.csv">Bottle All</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The columns are (in addition to the ones listed in the summary data):</p>
<ul>
<li>bottle: Bottle that water was drawn from (#) (lowest is deepest)</li>
<li>chla: chlorophyll-a concentration</li>
<li>no3: nitrate concentration</li>
<li>pH: pH</li>
<li>depth: Depth of bottle when it was closed</li>
<li>…then columns for the values recorded by the CTD when the bottles closed.</li>
</ul>
</div>
